TODO

FEATURE

IRGEN
- refactor common features to procedures: doAlloc, doStore, doLoad, doGEP

- write tests for equality methods?


LEXER
- rework errors
- properly eat whitespaces
- proc call doesn't fail without semicolon at the end

BUGS
- struct Node { /* value: Int; */ } Expected brackets after structure members. 
- let code = "1struct c { a: String; b :: 1; }" // this passes (with 1 at the start)
- you can pass string literal with no error as while condition
- endless loop: if (pointer != null) {  printf("%d\n", pointerToInt(pointer))); }
- func main() { a := (1 + 3) * (1 + 7 / -(5 + 3)) % 100 - 0.5; } // should resolve to float (because of 0.5)
